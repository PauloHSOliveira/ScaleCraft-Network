# ScaleCraft Network - Blockchain Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to the ScaleCraft Network Blockchain Portfolio. This project aims to create a blockchain network that represents Brazil, providing a secure and accessible financial system that is resistant to government interference and corruption. The goal is to develop a blockchain technology that becomes as globally recognized and influential as Ethereum.

## Project Overview
As a part of my journey to learn and develop blockchain technology, I am actively working on the ScaleCraft Network blockchain. While I'm in the process of studying Rust, I am simultaneously implementing different aspects of the blockchain. This project aims to bring together scalability, security, and innovative solutions to the blockchain ecosystem.

## Implemented Features
1. **Proof of Work Algorithm**: Implemented a Proof of Work consensus algorithm for block validation.
2. **Transaction Structure**: Designed a structure to represent transactions, including sender, receiver, and amount.
3. **Block Structure**: Created a block structure that holds transactions, timestamps, and previous hash information.
4. **Hashing with SHA-256**: Utilized the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for secure hashing of blocks and transactions.
5. **Blockchain Integrity Check**: Implemented blockchain integrity checks using previous hash and hash validation.
6. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Set up dynamic difficulty adjustment to control the mining process.
7. **Blockchain Print Info**: Added functionality to print block information.
8. **Blockchain Validation**: Implemented blockchain validation to ensure the integrity of the entire chain.

## Current Focus
My current focus is on refining the blockchain's architecture, optimizing performance, and adding more features that align with the goals of the ScaleCraft Network project. I am continuously studying Rust to improve my programming skills and enhance the blockchain's capabilities.

## Future Steps
In the upcoming phases, I plan to introduce more advanced features such as smart contracts, tokenization, and integration with real-world use cases.

## Contributions
I welcome collaboration and contributions from fellow blockchain enthusiasts, Rust developers, and anyone interested in innovative blockchain solutions. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in getting involved!
